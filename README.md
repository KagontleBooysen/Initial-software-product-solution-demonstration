## Description

Impilo is an innovative platform designed to aid in the early detection of lung cancer by analysing patient lung sound data. The project leverages advanced machine learning models and an intuitive web interface, making it accessible for healthcare professionals to capture patient data, perform lung sound analysis, and gain insights from visual representations of sound waves. By incorporating Firebase for data storage and authentication, along with deploying the application on platforms like Heroku or Netlify, Impilo aims to provide a seamless experience for users while ensuring data security and availability.

## How to Set Up the Environment

## Step 1: Install Anaconda
1. Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator.
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Once installed, open Anaconda Navigator.

## Step 2: Open Anaconda Navigator
1. Launch Anaconda Navigator from your start menu or applications folder.
2. You'll see the main Navigator interface, which allows you to manage environments and open applications like Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and Visual Studio Code.
3. Make sure you install Jupyter Notebook and Vs code.

## Step 3: Create a New Environment (Very Essential)
Impilo is created using the Anaconda environment, which is more organized, easy to navigate, and powerful in handling data without breakdowns. To run the project successfully, ensure your Anaconda is always running in the background.
1. In Navigator, go to the Environments tab on the left.
2. Click Create to open a dialog box.
3. Name the environment and select the Python version required for your project.

## Step 4: Install Necessary Packages
1. Select the environment you want to use (base or custom).
2. In the right pane, click on Search Packages to find and install any required packages by checking the boxes and clicking Apply.

## Step 5: File Explorer 
1. Extract the zip file with code sources to your local computer.
2. Save the extracted file to any folder and name it to your preference.
3. Copy the address of the folder you saved the source code into. Example: C:\Users\Lenovo\Impilo\Project\Code

## Step 6: Anaconda Navigator Environment
1. Go to the environment and access the environment you initially created in **Step 3**
2. You will see a **play button** click on it and wait for it to load all the packages.
3. Click on the **Play button** again and you will have access to the **"Open Terminal"**

## Step 7: Open Terminal
1. From here you can navigate to where the source code is **Example: C:\Users\Lenovo\Impilo\Project\Code**
2. You can run **pip install -r requirements.txt**
3. Lastly, you can run the app.py

## Step 8: Testing the platform
1. When performing clinical trials(Pre-trained audio sounds; consider using this audio file firstly: **normal1.wav** and the rest you can run them randomly!).
2. Real-time analysis you can record yourself and see something funðŸ˜Š
